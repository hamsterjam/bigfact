This is simply a program that calculates the factorials of very large numbers. I created this as an exercise to understand the mathematics behind multi-precision numbers. This includes creating a multi-precision integer type with fast implementations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This should probably not be used in any production code as [GNU MP](https://gmplib.org/) is faster and probably more reliable.
